        In India pepoples usually makes this dessert for special occasions, such as Diwali, when it starts getting
        cooler and lal gajar (red carrots) become available. This Punjabi dessert is subtle and divine without being
        super sweet, unlike most North Indian mithais or desserts. It's actually pretty healthy--or at least that’s what
        I tell myself so that I can eat copious quantities without feeling guilty! Almost a zen-like process, making
        gajar ka halwa is a labor of love; don’t rush. Enjoy the process. I had such a high bar for this recipe that I
        actually made it over ten times to get the exact same taste as when it’s made at home.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups whole milk (see Cook's Note)</li>
        <li>4 to 6 tablespoons ghee</li>
        <li>1/3 cup nuts, such as pistachios, almonds or cashews, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds carrot (about 8 carrots), peeled and coarsely grated on the large holes of a box grater (about
            5 cups; see Cook's Note)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cardamom seeds, crushed, optional</li>
        <li>3/4 cup light brown sugar, plus more if needed</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <hr>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Bring the milk to boil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat, stirring often to keep the
                milk from burning. Reduce the heat enough to keep the milk in a low boil, and cook, stirring frequently,
                until the milk is reduced to about 1 1/2 to 2 cups, about 20 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Heat 1 tablespoon ghee in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add the nuts and cook, stirring,
                until golden and crunchy, about 2 minutes; remove to a paper towel and set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>In the same skillet, add the carrots and cook over medium heat, stirring, until the carrots soften and
                dry up a little, about 15 minutes. If the carrots start sticking, add 1 tablespoon ghee.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Add the reduced milk and cardamom if using and increase the heat to medium-high. Mix well and bring to a
                boil. Reduce the heat a touch to maintain a heavy simmer, stirring regularly, until the milk is
                completely absorbed by the carrots, about 30 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Add the sugar and cook, stirring regularly, until thickened, 10 to 12 minutes. Taste and add more sugar
                if needed. Remove and discard the cardamom seeds if desired.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If serving right away, add 3 tablespoons of ghee and cook, stirring, until the halwa starts pulling away
                from the side of the pan and is a little caramelized, about 10 minutes. Garnish with nuts before
                serving.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Ideally, you should make the halwa earlier in the day or the day before. Just before serving, heat some
                ghee in a wok or large skillet (in India they would do it in a kadhai), add some of the halwa (just as
                much as you want to eat) and cook, stirring, until somewhat caramelized and a little crunchy. Garnish
                with the nuts and serve.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

        <strong>Cook’s Note: </strong><i>
            Instead of cooking down the milk, you can use 1 1/2 cups canned unsweetened evaporated milk. It saves you
            cleaning a pot and about some time, but the taste will never be as good as using fresh whole milk and
            reducing it and you don't get that nice crunchy caramelization. It's important that the carrots are coarsely
            grated, the halwa should have some texture and not be a total mash up.</i>
