        Cauliflower and potatoes come together with fragrant spices like turmeric, coriander and cumin in this hearty
        veg-forward curry enjoyed throughout India and Pakistan.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons Ginger-Garlic Paste, recipe follows, or 2 teaspoons grated ginger
        </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>1 cup water, divided</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons peanut oil</li>
        <li>1 large serrano pepper, split down the middle leaving halves attached</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 small head cauliflower, cut into small florets</li>
        <li>1 russet potato, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes (similar size to cauliflower)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons freshly minced cilantro leaves, to garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ginger-Garlic Paste:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup cloves garlic, whole </li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh ginger, peeled, cut into 1/2-inch slices</li>
        <li>1/4 cup canola oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <hr>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Mix the Ginger-Garlic Paste, coriander, turmeric, and 1/2 cup water in a small bowl. This is a simple wet
                masala (spice mix). Set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>In a large pot, warm the oil over medium-high heat until shimmering but not smoking. Add the serrano
                pepper, wait 30 seconds, and then add the cumin seeds and wait until they're done spluttering.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Add the wet masala (careful, it will also splutter). Cook until the paste thickens, deepens in color
                slightly, and oil oozes out of the perimeter of the masala, about 2 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Add the cauliflower and potatoes, stirring to coat the vegetables with the masala. Season with salt and
                add 1/2 cup water. Cover and cook over medium heat 10 to 15 minutes. Then, remove the lid, stir, and
                cook until the cauliflower and potatoes are cooked through, about 5 minutes. Garnish with cilantro and
                serve.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Throw the garlic, ginger, and canola oil in a mini-food processor and let it go until it forms a
                semi-smooth paste.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>There will still be tiny little pieces in there, but overall, it should resemble a paste.
                Save what you don't use in a small glass jar. It should last in the fridge for 2 to 3 weeks. It's a
                delicious addition to marinades, pasta sauces, stir fry sauces, slow-cooker recipes, gravy etc. We
                always had a jar of this stuff in our fridge growing up.</p>
