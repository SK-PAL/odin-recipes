    <h1>Thandai</h1>
    <p>Thandai is a rich and aromatic drink primarily made with almonds, white poppy seeds and melon seeds, and flavored
        with cardamom, fennel, pepper, saffron and rose petals. It’s a must-have during Holi, the spring festival of
        color in India, when bhang, an edible mixture made from the cannabis plant, is also added to the drink. Thandai
        is traditionally made with cow's milk, but it’s equally delectable with almond milk. Although you need a whole
        host of ingredients, it’s not difficult to make and is really refreshing and unique — even without the bhang.
        Not bad with a shot of vodka either!</p>

    <h1>Gulab Jamun</h1>
    <p>Decadent, sweet and delicious, a Gulab Jamun is a fried dough ball soaked in an aromatic simple syrup flavored with essence of rose (gulab) and infused with spices such as cardamom and saffron. It is then garnished with roasted nuts. One of the most popular desserts in North India, it is loved by children and adults alike. Unconventional as it may seem, the addition of alcohol in the syrup makes for a slightly less sweet syrup that is so delicious that you can't stop yourself from licking the spoon.</p>

    <h1>Matar Kachori</h1>
    <p>Matar, or fresh green peas, are the center of these flaky deep-fried snacks or kachoris. They originated in Rajasthan. Kachoris can have many different fillings. These particular ones are typically made when green peas are in season during winter and spring. The filling is lightly spiced; you don’t want to smother the taste of the green peas, just enhance it. It makes a great leftover snack and is as delicious as cold pizza is the next day.</p>
